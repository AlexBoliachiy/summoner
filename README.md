# hs-init

[![Build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/vrom911/hs-init.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/vrom911/hs-init)

Original idea is taken from [Aelve/new-hs](https://github.com/aelve/new-hs).

The only difference is that this script is for creating and setting up project using [Stack](http://haskellstack.org).

To use it, download `hs-init.hs` and then put it in your `PATH` (for instance, `/.local/bin`):

    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrom911/hs-init/master/hs-init.hs
    $ chmod +x hs-init.hs
    $ sudo mv hs-init.hs /.local/bin/hs-init

After that, call `hs-init`, answer the questions, and a new project would be created in a subfolder as well as github repository.
